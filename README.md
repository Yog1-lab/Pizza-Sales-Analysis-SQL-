🔍 SQL Data Analysis Project: Pizza Sales Dashboard
I recently completed a data analysis project focused on pizza sales, leveraging a dataset of over 48,000 transactions from a restaurant spanning one year. Using MySQL, I performed in-depth analyses to uncover actionable insights about customer behavior, sales performance, and revenue trends.
📊 Key Insights & Techniques:
Identified top-performing pizza types and categories.
Analyzed order patterns by time and size preferences.
Calculated revenue contributions and cumulative sales growth.
Used SQL techniques including JOINs, Subqueries, GROUP BY, and Cumulative Sums for data manipulation.
This project helped strengthen my skills in data querying, business intelligence, and deriving insights from real-world datasets.
